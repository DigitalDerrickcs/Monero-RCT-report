A cryptocurrency blockchain is commonly understood as a public distributed ledger containing transactions 
verifiable by third parties, be it the mining community or the public in general.
It would seem that transactions would need to be sent and stored in clear text format in order to
make them publicly verifiable.

As we will show in this report, this is an incorrect assumption. It is indeed possible to use cryptographic
artifacts to conceal participants of transactions as well as the amounts involved. And yet, allow transactions
to be verified and consensuated by the mining community.
